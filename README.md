# Infix-Evaluator

I just made a command line calculator in C language. It supports multiple and nested brackets. 
It performs by 2 functions calling each other recursively to solve an infix expression. It reports "error in expression!" if given input is having wrong syntax.

### To Do
1) Add long long instead of int to support bigger number arithmatic
2) Add sin, cos, tan, log etc functions
